# Remote PC

This is a nodejs + svelte based application to control your computer from another
device. This is intended only for simple media, mouse and keyboard control.
You must also be on the same network as the host.

You might be interested in [rustdesk](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk) which
is more advanced and allows for connections between different networks.
